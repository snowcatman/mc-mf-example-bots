!!! Beginner to Intermediate Coding !!!

As of Jan. 2021
 The mineflayer pages and docs(defenantly have more info:)
 gives you the bare bones of a starting your own do nothing bot.
 But there is more than one right way to code your a do nothing bot.
 The first thing you want to get down is consistancy. Making all your spaces the same
 and "Santex". You will need to go back many time and look for any mispellings. 
 Anything unwanted code can throw an error and/or give you unwanted results.
 
- example: 
          0| const mineflayer = require('mineflayer');
          1| const bot = mineflayer.createBot()
          
        In this example this would be the bear bones that you need to just show up in a 
     offline local server on your own pc with the defualts in mind.
        With that I want to give you a piece of advice. Don't go for the latest and greatest.
     Meaning use vanilla server like 1.8.9 and play with the code. Once you find that it 
     works you can expand on the code and the versions of software you are actually here for.
     It just makes knowing what your doing a bite easier to chew on and learn. Thank you.
     
Please help me make this for those that ned it. Again Thank you..
